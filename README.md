# 2D-Histogram-Filter-Self-Driving-Car
This project is a 2D histogram filter based on the Udacity histogram filter project and guidelines. 

# Compiling the project
To compile the project I highly recommend using C++ 11 since other versions may not work properly. To specify your version do the following: 
'''
$ g++ -std=c++11 tests.cpp
$ ./a.out
'''
# Optimization
C++ is known for its speed -- and thus should be optimized to work as fast as possible. Currently I am working on optimizing it to run much faster and function a whole lot better.
